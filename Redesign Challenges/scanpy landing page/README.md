## Overview
Scanpy, one of the most widely used python ecosystems for single-cell workflows, offers robust tutorials that walk users from raw matrices to embeddings, clustering, and downstream interpretation. The landing page is the first point of contact for someone who is learning how to interact with this ecosystem. However its current structure is not friendly to all users. 

In this project I wanted  to analyze the current landing page experience and identify where the UX could better support users.

This case study focuses on:

- What users need

- Where the current experience falls short

- Opportunities to make the tutorial landing page more navigable, approachable, and “learnable.”

## Thought Process
- (insert flow)
- **Primary result:** One short sentence summarizing the most important finding.
- **Impact:** What this means for stakeholders.
- **Quick numbers:** `Metric A: X` · `Metric B: Y`

## Painpoints
| Pain Points | Why It Was a Problem | Design Improvement | Impact / Result |
|---:|:---|:---|:---:|
|No clear CTA (call to action) | Users don’t know what to do next (install? try tutorial? read docs?) | Added primary buttons for “Install”, “Try a Tutorial”, “Explore Docs” | Creates a guided first step and improves conversions into the ecosystem
| Objective 2 | Clear measurable criteria | Medium |
