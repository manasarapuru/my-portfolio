## Overview
Scanpy is one of the most widely used Python ecosystems for single-cell transcriptomics, offering tutorials that guide users from raw matrices to embeddings, clustering, and downstream interpretation. Because the tutorial landing page is the primary gateway into this ecosystem, its usability is essential for helping users understand the workflow and onboard smoothly.

*Scanpy's Landing Page*

In this project, I applied Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) principles to evaluate and redesign the Scanpy tutorial landing experience. My goal was to make the page more learnable, navigable, and inclusive for users across different coding backgrounds.

---

## Problem

Although Scanpy is powerful, its landing page creates friction for new users—especially those without strong computational backgrounds. The main issues stem from unclear information hierarchy, developer-centric framing, and a lack of guided pathways.

Core problems identified:

- Users cannot tell where to begin.

- The information hierarchy does not match users’ mental models.

- The page caters primarily to developers, not scientists with mixed coding experience.

- Heavy text and scattered links make the page hard to scan quickly.

These issues result in higher cognitive load, longer onboarding time, and missed opportunities to help users grasp the workflow.

## Research & Evaluation

### Methods Used:
- Heuristic Evaluation based on Nielsen’s usability heuristics
(visibility of system status, user control, consistency, recognition over recall)

- Content audit of the landing page

- Analysis of user roles (biologists, computational researchers, students, developers)

- Mentored review sessions with two peers to test first-time navigation approaches

- Pathway mapping to compare intended vs. actual user navigation

### Key Insights:
- New users gravitated toward the most colorful or bold links—not the correct starting point.

- Many expected a “Start Here” or “Getting Started” area and were confused not to find one.

- Users with biology backgrounds felt overwhelmed by code-heavy phrasing.

- Users were unsure whether to begin with the tutorials, installation, or documentation.

- Scannability issues caused users to skim past important orientation content.

## Design Goals

Design Goals

From the insights above, I defined three main design goals:

- Improve Learnability
    - Provide clearer orientation and a recommended starting point.

- Enhance Navigation & Information Architecture
    - Help users quickly find what they need, reducing guessing and backtracking.

- Make the Experience More Inclusive
    - Support both developer-level and non-developer users with progressive disclosure.

| Pain Point                         | Why It Was a Problem (HCI Perspective)                          | Design Improvement                                                    | Result / Impact                                           |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **No clear CTA (call to action)**  | Increased cognitive load; users forced to infer next step.      | Added primary CTAs: **Install**, **Try a Tutorial**, **Explore Docs** | Clear first action; smoother ecosystem entry.             |
| **Hard-to-find beginner guidance** | Violated “match with users’ mental models.” No onboarding path. | Created **Start Here** pathway with Quickstart + Beginner Tutorials   | Faster onboarding; fewer navigational errors.             |
| **Dense, text-heavy layout**       | Low scannability and poor visual hierarchy.                     | Introduced simplified hero section and stronger hierarchy             | Users immediately understand Scanpy’s purpose.            |
| **Developer-centric tone**         | Excluded users with weaker coding backgrounds.                  | Added non-technical explanations and progressive disclosure           | More inclusive experience; accessible to all researchers. |





In this project I wanted  to analyze the current landing page experience and identify where the UX could better support users.

This case study focuses on:

- What users need

- Where the current experience falls short

- Opportunities to make the tutorial landing page more navigable, approachable, and “learnable.”

## Painpoints
| Pain Points | Why It Was a Problem | Design Improvement | Impact / Result |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|No clear CTA (call to action) | Users don’t know what to do next (install? try tutorial? read docs?) | Added primary buttons for “Install”, “Try a Tutorial”, “Explore Docs” | Creates a guided first step and improves conversions into the ecosystem
| Hard-to-find beginner guidance | New users don’t know where to start; often jump into advanced docs | Added a “Start Here” pathway with Quickstart + Beginner Tutorials | Improves onboarding and reduces bounce rate for new users |
Dense, text-heavy homepage | Users can’t quickly understand what Scanpy does or who it’s for | Introduced a simplified hero section with a crisp value statement and visual hierarchy | Users immediately understand the tool and can self-identify relevance |
| More Developer Friendly | Scanpy is used by researchers of all coding experiences, this developer tutorial friendly framework does not make it accessible to others as much | | |
