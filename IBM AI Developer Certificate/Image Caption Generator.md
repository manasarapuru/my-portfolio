### Learnings:
- Use Python, BLIP model and gradio to create image caption generation tool

### What is Hugging Face?
- An opensource AI platform
- Pytorch: Deep learning library
- Tensor Flow: Machine learning platform
- Google JAX: Machine learning framework

- Hugging Face helps businesses:
  - add or remove features to improve the efficiency of their models
  - evaluate their generative AI models to filter biased data
  - create multimodal applications with text, image, audio, and video generation capabilities.
 
- BLIP:
  - learns to associate images with relevant text, allowing it to generate captions, answer image-related questions, and support image-based search queries.
  - Enhanced understanding: It provides a more nuanced understanding of the content within images, going beyond object recognition to comprehend scenes, actions, and interactions.
  - Multimodal learning: By integrating text and image data, BLIP facilitates multimodal learning, which is closer to how humans perceive the world.
  - Accessibility: Generating accurate image descriptions can make content more accessible to people with visual impairments.
  - Content creation: It supports creative and marketing endeavors by generating descriptive texts for visual content, saving time and enhancing creativity.
